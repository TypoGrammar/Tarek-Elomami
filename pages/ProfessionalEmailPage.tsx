      <ArticleHeading>1. The Subject Line: Clear and Concise</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        The subject line is the first thing your recipient sees. It should be informative and brief, giving the reader a clear idea of the email's content.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <BulletList items={[
        <><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of "Question", try "Question about the Marketing Report".</>,
        <><strong>Include key information:</strong> If relevant, include dates, names, or reference numbers. Example: "Meeting Confirmation: Project Alpha, Oct 28".</>,
        <><strong>Keep it short:</strong> Aim for under 10 words.</>,
      ]} />
      <ExampleList items={['Marketing Internship Application - John Doe', 'Follow-up on our meeting last Tuesday', 'Urgent: Update on the Q4 Budget']} />

      <ArticleHeading>2. The Salutation: Formal and Respectful</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        Always start with a polite greeting. The level of formality depends on your relationship with the recipient.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <BulletList items={[
          <><strong>Formal:</strong> Use "Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last Name]," when you don't know the person well or they are in a position of authority.</>,
          <><strong>Slightly less formal:</strong> "Dear [First Name]," is acceptable if you have an established relationship.</>,
          <><strong>Avoid overly casual greetings:</strong> Steer clear of "Hey," or "Hi there," in initial or formal correspondence.</>,
          <><strong>If you don't know the name:</strong> Use a general salutation like "Dear Hiring Manager," or "To Whom It May Concern:".</>,
      ]} />

      <ArticleHeading>3. The Body: Get to the Point</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        The body of your email should be clear, concise, and easy to read.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <BulletList items={[
        <><strong>State your purpose early:</strong> In the first sentence, explain why you are writing. "I am writing to inquire about..." or "I am writing to follow up on...".</>,
        <><strong>Use short paragraphs:</strong> Break your text into small paragraphs of 2-3 sentences each. This improves readability.</>,
        <><strong>Be clear and direct:</strong> Avoid jargon and overly complex sentences. State what you need or what you are offering clearly.</>,
        <><strong>Proofread:</strong> Always check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors before sending. An error-free email shows professionalism.</>,
      ]} />

      <ArticleHeading>4. The Closing and Signature</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        End your email with a polite closing, followed by your name and contact information.
      </ArticleParagraph>
       <BulletList items={[
        <><strong>Professional Closings:</strong> "Sincerely," "Best regards," "Kind regards," or "Thank you," are all safe choices.</>,
        <><strong>Your Name:</strong> Use your full name.</>,
        <><strong>Signature Block:</strong> Include your title, company (if applicable), and phone number. This makes it easy for the recipient to contact you.</>,
      ]} />
