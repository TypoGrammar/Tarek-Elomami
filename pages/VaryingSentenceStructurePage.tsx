      <ArticleParagraph>
        Good writing is not just about correct grammar; it's also about rhythm and flow. Varying your sentence structure is one of the most effective ways to make your prose more dynamic, sophisticated, and engaging for your reader. Repetitive sentence patterns can make even the most interesting ideas feel monotonous. This guide will show you several techniques to break out of that monotony.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleHeading>1. Vary Your Sentence Beginnings</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        The most common sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object. While this is grammatically correct, starting every sentence with the subject can become predictable. Try starting sentences in different ways.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <BulletList items={[
        <><strong>Start with a Prepositional Phrase:</strong> A prepositional phrase (e.g., <InlineCode>in the morning</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>under the bridge</InlineCode>) can add context and variety. <br/>
          <em>Repetitive:</em> He walked his dog in the park every morning. <br/>
          <em>Varied:</em> <span className="font-semibold">In the park every morning,</span> he walked his dog.</>,
        <><strong>Start with an Adverb:</strong> An adverb can modify the verb and change the rhythm of the sentence. <br/>
          <em>Repetitive:</em> The cat crept silently across the floor. <br/>
          <em>Varied:</em> <span className="font-semibold">Silently,</span> the cat crept across the floor.</>,
        <><strong>Start with a Dependent Clause:</strong> A dependent clause adds information and creates a more complex sentence structure. Remember to use a comma after the introductory clause. <br/>
          <em>Repetitive:</em> We will go to the beach if the weather is nice. <br/>
          <em>Varied:</em> <span className="font-semibold">If the weather is nice,</span> we will go to the beach.</>,
      ]} />

      <ArticleHeading>2. Combine Ideas into Different Sentence Types</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        Instead of writing a series of short, simple sentences, combine them to show the relationship between ideas. This creates a more fluid reading experience.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <BulletList items={[
        <><strong>Use a Coordinating Conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so):</strong> This creates a compound sentence. <br/>
          <em>Simple:</em> She studied hard. She did not pass the test. <br/>
          <em>Combined:</em> She studied hard, <span className="font-semibold">but</span> she did not pass the test.</>,
        <><strong>Use a Semicolon:</strong> A semicolon can link two closely related independent clauses. <br/>
          <em>Simple:</em> The presentation was informative. It was also engaging. <br/>
          <em>Combined:</em> The presentation was informative<span className="font-semibold">;</span> it was also engaging.</>,
        <><strong>Use a Subordinating Conjunction:</strong> Turn one of the sentences into a dependent clause to create a complex sentence. <br/>
          <em>Simple:</em> The team lost the game. They played with heart. <br/>
          <em>Combined:</em> <span className="font-semibold">Although</span> the team lost the game, they played with heart.</>,
      ]} />

      <ArticleHeading>3. Mix the Four Sentence Types</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
        Effective writing uses a mix of the four basic sentence types to create rhythm and emphasis. Consciously try to include all of them in your paragraphs.
      </ArticleParagraph>
      <CodeBlock>{`1. Simple Sentence: One independent clause.
   (The sun shines.)

2. Compound Sentence: Two or more independent clauses.
   (The sun shines, and the birds sing.)

3. Complex Sentence: One independent clause and one or more dependent clauses.
   (When the sun shines, the birds sing.)

4. Compound-Complex Sentence: Two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.
   (When the sun shines, the birds sing, and the world feels bright.)`}</CodeBlock>

      <h3 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-slate-200">Example: Before and After</h3>
      <ArticleParagraph>Notice how mixing sentence types improves the flow of this paragraph.</ArticleParagraph>
      <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900/30 dark:border-red-500 dark:text-red-300">
        <p className="font-bold">Before (Monotonous):</p>
        <p>The city can be a noisy place. Cars honk their horns constantly. People talk loudly on their phones. Sirens wail at all hours. It is hard to find peace.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 text-green-800 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:border-green-500 dark:text-green-300">
        <p className="font-bold">After (Varied):</p>
        <p>The city can be a noisy place. While cars constantly honk their horns, people also talk loudly on their phones, and sirens wail at all hours. Because of the constant noise, finding peace is often a difficult challenge.</p>
      </div>
      
      <ArticleHeading>Conclusion</ArticleHeading>
      <ArticleParagraph>
