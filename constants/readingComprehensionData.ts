        "Impressionism was a radical art movement that began in the late 19th century in Paris, France. It marked a profound departure from the traditional, academic style of painting that had dominated European art for centuries. The Impressionists sought to capture a fleeting moment and the sensory effect of a scene—the 'impression'—rather than a detailed, realistic depiction. Key figures of this movement include Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro. They challenged the established art world, organizing their own independent exhibitions after being rejected by the official Paris Salon."

One of the most notable is the use of relatively small, thin, yet visible brushstrokes that create a sense of movement and changing light. The artists were fascinated by light and color, and they often painted 'en plein air' (outdoors) to observe and capture the momentary effects of sunlight. They used a bright, vibrant palette and often applied unmixed colors directly to the canvas, allowing the viewer's eye to mix them optically. Their subject matter was also modern, focusing on everyday life—landscapes, cityscapes, and scenes of middle-class leisure—rather than the historical, religious, or mythological themes favored by the academic tradition."

Critics found their work to be sketchy, unfinished, and lacking in skill. However, over time, the public\'s perception began to change. The Impressionists\' innovative approach to light, color, and subject matter paved the way for modern art, influencing subsequent movements like Post-Impressionism and Cubism.

They might change their behavior (quit smoking), which is often the most difficult path. Alternatively, they might try to justify their behavior by changing one of the dissonant cognitions. For instance, they could downplay the health risks ('The risks are not as severe as they say')."

By adding these new thoughts, they create a mental balance that makes the contradictory behavior feel more acceptable.

At convergent boundaries, plates collide. This can result in one plate being forced to slide beneath the other (a process called subduction) or in both plates crumpling and pushing upwards to form massive mountain ranges, like the Himalayas.

        "Social norms are the unwritten rules of behavior that are considered acceptable within a particular group or society. They function as a kind of social glue, guiding our interactions and creating a sense of predictability and order. Norms tell us what is 'normal' in a given situation, from how to greet someone to what to wear to a formal event. While laws are formal, written rules, norms are informal and are learned through observation, socialization, and interaction with others."

        "Sociologists often categorize norms into different types. 'Folkways' are the customs of everyday life, like saying 'please' and 'thank you' or not talking with your mouth full. Violating a folkway might be seen as rude, but it doesn't typically provoke a strong reaction. 'Mores' (pronounced mor-ays) are norms that are based on moral values and beliefs. Actions like stealing or cheating are violations of mores, and they often result in more serious social disapproval. 'Taboos' are the most powerful type of norm; they are actions that are considered so offensive or repellent that they are almost unthinkable within a society. Norms are enforced through social sanctions, which can be positive (like a smile or a compliment for conforming) or negative (like a frown or social ostracism for violating)."

        "It is important to remember that social norms are not universal; they vary significantly from one culture to another. For example, a common greeting in one culture might be a firm handshake, while in another it might be a bow. What is considered polite in one society may be rude in another. These cultural differences highlight the socially constructed nature of norms and their importance in shaping our daily lives and maintaining social order."
